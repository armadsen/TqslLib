# TqslLib
This is a project to build an (OS X) framework for the ARRL's [TqslLib](http://sourceforge.net/projects/trustedqsl/files/tqsllib/). Currently it is actually set up to build [my fork](http://sourceforge.net/u/armadsen/trustedqsl/) of that project.

I'm making it public in the hope that it's useful, but without any warranty or offer of support whatsoever.
